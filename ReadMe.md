# ML & DL Algorithms from Scratch

This repository contains implementations of fundamental Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) algorithms from scratch using NumPy and PyTorch. The purpose of this project is to learn and reinforce concepts by coding them manually.

The journey is divided into weekly milestones(tentative), culminating in a comprehensive collection of algorithms and models.

## How to Use

    Clone the repository:

    bash

    git clone https://github.com/VIVEKGANGA/ML-DL-Algorithms-From-Scratch.git

    Explore Algorithms:
    Each file contains implementations of core algorithms. For NumPy-based algorithms, check the NumPy folder, and for PyTorch-based models, navigate to the PyTorch folder.

    Run Examples:
    The code is structured to be modular, allowing you to directly run or modify the algorithms by providing your own datasets.
